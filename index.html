      <h2>About Benard.</h2>
        <p>My name is  Mark Murimi  and am a web designer currently at  Moringa School
          where i acquired my coding skills.</p>
        <p>I came up with an idea of creating a webpage for my pet Benard because he means much to me.</p>
        <p>Benard is 16 years of age and i have taken care of him since he was little.</p>
        <p>Below are his hobbies or rather what he likes doing.</p>
      <div class="momo">
        <p><em>Playing fetch.</em></p>
        <p><em>Watching movies.</em></p>
        <p><em>Swimming.</em></p>
        <p><em>Playing ball.</em></p>
        <p><em>And most of all hanging out with me.</em></p>
        <p>He is a the greatest companion man can ever ask for. I thank God for him.</p>
        <p><b><em>THANK YOU!</em></b></p>
